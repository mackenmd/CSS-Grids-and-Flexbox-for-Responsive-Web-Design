>> Jen Kramer: Are there any outstanding remaining questions on Flexbox or Grid or layout?
>> Speaker 2: Are you absolutely sure that Flexbox and Grid's CSS work 100% with Google Chrome and Edge?
>> Jen Kramer: That they will work in Chrome and Edge or that they do work in Chrome and Edge?
>> Speaker 2: They do work in Chrome and Edge.

[00:00:22]

>> Jen Kramer: I am 100% certain that grid works in Chrome. I'm 99% certain it works in Edge. If it's not today, it is this month. Edge is supposed to come online this month. We can check, can I use,
>> Jen Kramer: So let's see here. Here's my page, can I use

[00:00:49]

>> Speaker 2: Yeah it's a maroon, partial support.
>> Jen Kramer: Yeah, so as you see here I guess the current version of Edge is Edge 15 Edge 16 is the next version, it is scheduled to come online and be completely cross browser compatible, so it's coming, it's coming and I have read that Edge is supposed to be out this month, I don't know the exact date.

[00:01:12]
Fabulous, thank you all so much for sticking with me for the last two days. I appreciate it very much. I appreciate it it takes a lot of time out of your day and a lot of time away from clients and other things that you have to do to come and attend a training like this.
